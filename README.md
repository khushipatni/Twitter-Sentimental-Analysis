# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
**Natural Language Processing** is a branch of Artificial Intelligence which deal with bridging the machines understanding humans in their Natural Language. Natural Language can be in form of text or sound, which are used for humans to communicate each other. NLP can enable humans to communicate to machines in a natural way.
Text Classification is a process involved in Sentiment Analysis. It is classification of peoples opinion or expressions into different sentiments. Sentiments in this dataset include Positive, Neutral, and Negative. Sentiment Analysis can be done on different consumer centered industries to analyse people's opinion on a particular product or subject.

## Project Description
- A Sentimental Analysis model using Natural Language Processing. The dataset contains 1.6 million twitter comments of the users which can be downloaded from [Twitter-Dataset](training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv) . 
- The Preprocessing involves cleaning texts by removing non-alphabetical characters and stopwords. We used porter stemmer for removing the commoner morphological and inflexional endings from words. 
-  Performed train test split and generated Bag of Words model on the training set. In this, a text is represented as the bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity. 

## Accuracy
- Future Scope: The accuracy can still be optimized based on the Hyper Parameter Tuning to fit the model much better over the testing data.
